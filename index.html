    <p id="p1"> I'm 22 years old, born and raised here in Denver, CO. I've been interested in tech from a young age and I hope to
                someday make it into my career. I'm excited to continue to develop my skills and learn what it takes to become
                a software engineer. I can't wait to work alongside everyone over these next 15 weeks.
